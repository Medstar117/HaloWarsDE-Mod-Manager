# HaloWarsDE Mod Manager
A handy mod manager for Halo Wars: Definitive Edition. Supports both Steam and Microsoft Store versions.

This repository serves as a means for sharing the manager's source code for public review and contribution (that, and considering the fact that anyone can fetch the source for this using something like DotPeek or ILSpy XD); and for the distribution of auto-update packages via the Releases section.

## How To Install
1) Download the HaloWarsDE-ModManager-Unpacker.exe file from <a href="">HERE</a>
2) Run the executable
3) Tell the unpacker where you want to extract the mod manager (don't worry about loose files, it'll extract it to its own folder wherever you tell it to unpack to)
4) Run the mod manager! It will create a shortcut on your desktop if one does not already exist
5) Either double click the shortcut or the HaloWarsDE Mod Manager.exe file, and play!
